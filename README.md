=====

4ward is a casual 2D role-playing game with elements of tower defense and puzzle games dedicated to the tablet and phone in which four protagonists from separate worlds must use their individual abilities and an universal teleportation skill to realize their strengths, accept their weaknesses  and work together to defeat their common nemesis and protect their species. As waves of enemies approach each hero, the player must send these pests up or down to the protagonist who can serve the most damage based on visual cues in order to efficiently clear the way out and reach the source of the infestation.
